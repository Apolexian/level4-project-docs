* Both implementation of QUIC and a port to MQTT is out of scope for the duration of the project
  * Scope down to either QUIC implementation or MQTT port using an existing QUIC implementation
  * Need to have a clearly defined set of target goals/ set of problems to target
* Can use mininet for simulation of mesh networks provided it can simulate a link
* Will probably have to cut down the stack if the approach of existing QUIC implementation is used
* If going for the implementation need to have criteria in some sort of moscow form
