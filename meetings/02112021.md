## Progress

* Emailed authors about the paper source code but no reply
* Yet to get numbers from the report (Mihail said his numbers would not be useful)
* Got QuicSocket to do Retry, Version Negotiation, and Handshake to work (based on quiche .is_established())
* Left question on quiche repo to do with streams

## Questions

* How long to wait before chasing up second author?

## Notes



## Plan for this week

* Continue with port, hopefully get stream send to work by next week
* Write email to second author of paper about the source code
