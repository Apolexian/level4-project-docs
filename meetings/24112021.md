## Progress

* Figured out that quiche does not support async
* Tried to create wraper using tokio for quiche but this would take too much time
* Explored quinn as a possible alternative to using quiche
* Re-wrote the library using quinn but the tls certificate generation method provided does not work

## Questions

* Possible solutions (things that I have missed) for solving the tls certificate issue

## Notes

* Can ask about this issue on the QUIC slack channel

## Plan for this week

* Continue trying to use quinn implementation
* Ask on slack about possible solutions to the certificate generation problem
