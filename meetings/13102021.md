# 13 Oct 2021

## Progress

* Formalised priorities
* Made rough timeline
* Created small mininet script to run quiche
* Created vagrantfile

## Questions

* Is one month roughly right amount of time for dissertation?
* Wireshark not recognising UDP traffic on port 443 as quic packets?
* Why did the cycle programming language not take off? What are rusts benefits over it to consider?

## Notes

* Plan + timeline looks reasonable, will see how much of it can get done by the end
* For KP-ABE, either analysis or implementation would be reasonable, don't have to do both if not enough time
* Would be good to turn the priorities (with more discussion) and timeline into latex in preparation for status report
* Can have a chat with Mihail about mininet and the wireshark question, look at his scripts and topologies
* Probably best to implement some sort of dumbell topology with 2 switches
* Lookout for peculiarities with tokio when considering where tcp streams need to be ported

## Plan for this week

* Write up priorities with more discussion and timeline in latex
* Look at code for mqtt implementation
* Test mqtt implementation on local + mininet
* Look at interface for tcp stream and what needs to be adapted
