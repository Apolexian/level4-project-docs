## Progress

* Emailed authors about the paper source code but no reply (again)
* Got stream send and receive to work standalone but event loop does not trigger on send when using it in rumqtt

## Questions

* How to debug the eventloop bug?
* Should I think about scope in case this doesn't work this week?

## Notes

* Still have time to solve this so no re-scope needed yet
* Should switch to  using tokio because rumqtt is async so needs to support the async eventloop and mio loop may be interfering

## Plan for this week

* Switch implementation to use tokio
* Debug the mqtt event loop further
