# 7 Oct 2021

## Pre-meeting prep

* Re-scoped project to option with porting existing MQTT implementation to existing QUIC implementation
* Analysis will focus on:
  * Use of encryption in header and payloads to prevent eavesdropping and snoop attacks
  * Use of encryption in header and payloads to ensure data integrity
  * Performance of rust implementations of MQTT QUIC versus both MQTT TCP and MQTT QUIC in C
  * Methods of thinning down MQTT and QUIC to reduce binary sizes, stack and heap allocation
  * Evaluate TLS versus KP-ABE
  * Explore different methods of session re-establishment in QUIC to prevent keep-alive packet snoop attack
  * How authentication prevents attacks via simple subscribing to all topics on a broker, so evaluate authenticated handshake in QUIC
* Top choice for MQTT library: https://github.com/bschwind/mqtt-broker
  * Implementation is simple compared to other  implementations, so it will be easier to port and thin down
  * Says its a broker but also has a client
* Top choice for QUIC library: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche better examples than quinn and seems to have less overhead
* For evaluation test-bench:
  * Will try run quiche normally on my devices and see if it works with my internet provider
  * Alternatively will figure out mininet
