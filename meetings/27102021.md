## Progress

* Made progress on port
  * Created QuicSocket and Listener interfaces that wrap around quiche and use tokio
  * Created functions to send and recv
  * Published that as a crate so I can use it easier
* Read ofcom report to find values to use for mininet testing later on
* Read chrome source code to see what values they use for their network simulation

## Questions

* Have not found simulations numbers for Zigbee so not sure where to find those, will read more about it

## Notes
