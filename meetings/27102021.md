# 20 Oct 2021

## Progress

* Made progress on port
  * Created QuicSocket and Listener interfaces that wrap around quiche and use tokio
  * Created functions to send and recv
  * Published that as a crate so I can use it easier
* Read ofcom report to find values to use for mininet testing later on
* Read chrome source code to see what values they use for their network simulation

## Questions

* Have not found simulations numbers for Zigbee so not sure where to find those, will read more about it

## Notes

* Should follow up with Mihail about ofcom numbers
* Should email authors of QUIC MQTT implementation about their source code
* UDP socket sepparate to quiche semantics could be to support Multiplexing schemes: https://csperkins.org/standards/ietf-111/draft-ietf-avtcore-rfc7983bis-01.txt
* Can check the following to try deduce general traffic models
  * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8593/
  * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8867/
  * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8868/
  * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8869/
* ACM IMC 2021 is worth checking for interesting sessions

## Plan for this week

* Continue with QuicSocket implementation and port
* Try to obtain source code for the QUIC MQTT paper
* Follow up with Mihail about simulation numbers
