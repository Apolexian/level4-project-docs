## Progress

* Switched quic mininet script to a dumbbell topology
* Created mqtt mininet script
* Wrote up motivation and plan for report
* Identified the interfaces that have to be implemented for port and started to port

## Questions

* Simulating links and packet loss in mininet?
* How to best structure the quic code needed for port?
* Can just get rid of TLS layer in mqtt and keep quic one?
* Multiple server/client setup in mininet?

## Notes

* Need to check linux traffic models and their implementations in mininet for different link simulations (especially for packet loss patterns)
* Don't need many clients connecting in parallel unless I want to test scalability
* Generally setup of clients and servers depends on what I want to test
* The structure should be similar to how tokio does it with TCP right now, i.e. make a QUIC socket structure, QUIC listener and QUIC stream and use them as they are used now in rumqtt
* TLS on mqtt layer not needed unless extra encryption needed (e.g when there may be a known backdoor), but for IoT this is too costly
* Test bench would take some usual mqtt data and use different link simulations to test the client and server
* Need to see what data I want to collect during these tests

## Plan for this week

* Start on abstractions for quic, i.e. Socket, Listener, Stream
* Ask Mihail and research linux traffic models for link simulation and packet loss patterns
* Tweak mininet scripts to include link simulations and different number of client/servers depending on what I need to test
