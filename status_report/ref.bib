	title = {Implementation and {Analysis} of {QUIC} for {MQTT}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07730},
	abstract = {Transport and security protocols are essential to ensure reliable and secure communication between two parties. For IoT applications, these protocols must be lightweight, since IoT devices are usually resource constrained. Unfortunately, the existing transport and security protocols -- namely TCP/TLS and UDP/DTLS -- fall short in terms of connection overhead, latency, and connection migration when used in IoT applications. In this paper, after studying the root causes of these shortcomings, we show how utilizing QUIC in IoT scenarios results in a higher performance. Based on these observations, and given the popularity of MQTT as an IoT application layer protocol, we integrate MQTT with QUIC. By presenting the main APIs and functions developed, we explain how connection establishment and message exchange functionalities work. We evaluate the performance of MQTTw/QUIC versus MQTTw/TCP using wired, wireless, and long-distance testbeds. Our results show that MQTTw/QUIC reduces connection overhead in terms of the number of packets exchanged with the broker by up to 56\%. In addition, by eliminating half-open connections, MQTTw/QUIC reduces processor and memory usage by up to 83\% and 50\%, respectively. Furthermore, by removing the head-of-line blocking problem, delivery latency is reduced by up to 55\%. We also show that the throughput drops experienced by MQTTw/QUIC when a connection migration happens is considerably lower than that of MQTTw/TCP.},

	abstract = {This study aims to serve as a useful manual of existing security threats and vulnerabilities of the IoT heterogeneous environment and proposes possible solutions for improving the IoT security architecture. The Internet of things (IoT) has recently become an important research topic because it integrates various sensors and objects to communicate directly with one another without human intervention. The requirements for the large-scale deployment of the IoT are rapidly increasing with a major security concern. This study focuses on the state-of-the-art IoT security threats and vulnerabilities by conducting an extensive survey of existing works in the area of IoT security. The taxonomy of the current security threats in the contexts of application, architecture, and communication is presented. This study also compares possible security threats in the IoT. We discuss the IoT security scenario and provide an analysis of the possible attacks. Open research issues and security implementation challenges in IoT security are described as well. This study aims to serve as a useful manual of existing security threats and vulnerabilities of the IoT heterogeneous environment and proposes possible solutions for improving the IoT security architecture.},

	abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a new cryptographic primitive which provides a promising tool for addressing the problem of secure and fine-grained data sharing and decentralized access control. Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) is an important class of ABE, where cipher texts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which cipher texts a user is able to decrypt. KP-ABE has important applications in data sharing on untrusted cloud storage. However, the cipher text size grows linearly with the number of attributes embedded in cipher text in most existing KP-ABE schemes. In this paper, we describe our work on designing a KP-ABE scheme with constant size cipher text for monotonic access structures. The downside of the proposed KP-ABE scheme is that private keys have multiple size growth in the number of attributes in the access structure. The proposed KP-ABE scheme is proved to be secure under the general Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) relies on sensor devices to measure real-world phenomena in order to provide IoT services. The sensor readings are shared with multiple entities, such as IoT services, other IoT devices or other third parties. The collected data may be sensitive and include personal information. To protect the privacy of the users, the data needs to be protected through an encryption algorithm. For sharing cryptographic cipher-texts with a group of users Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is well suited, as it does not require to create group keys. However, the creation of ABE cipher-texts is slow when executed on resource constraint devices, such as IoT sensors. In this paper, we present a modiﬁcation of an ABE scheme, which not only allows to encrypt data efﬁciently using ABE, but also reduces the size of the cipher-text, that must be transmitted by the sensor. We also show how our modiﬁcation can be used to realise an instantaneous key revocation mechanism.},
